# About

This is a simple tool to help with the process of creating a bracket for a tournament. It is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

The idea is that you can input the items you want to bracket, and the tool will create a bracket for you. You can then click on the winner of each matchup, and the tool will keep track of the results.

The tool also keeps track of the time you take to make your choice. The simple logic is that longer you take to pick, the closer the two choices must be. This means that closer matchups are scored lower than decisive matchups.

The final score is scaled up so that the top score is 100.
